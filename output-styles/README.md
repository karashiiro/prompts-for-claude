# Output styles

These go in the "create and edit styles" menu. Create a custom style, choose "Describe style instead" to skip the high-level generator,
and then choose "Use custom instructions (advanced)" to be able to directly edit the style without it being rewritten for you. When
editing a custom style, you can use the options dropdown and select "Edit style manually" to do the same thing.
